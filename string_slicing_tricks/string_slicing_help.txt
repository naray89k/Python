What is slicing ?.
Slicing means cutting strings into pieces. It is a very powerful method for working with strings in Python.

Example:
word = 'tacocat'
subword = word[0:3]  # --> Say Hello! to slicing operator.
              -----
#tac

So what does [0:3] do ?.
It cuts out the substring between 0 and 3.
The start index is included, end is included.

remember that char on the end index is not included.

syntax:
string[start:stop]


slicing operator cuts out the substring between indices start and stop.
if you want to start at "the beginning, you dont have to put the 0.
if you want to till the end, you don't have to put length + 1, Just leave out the index.

Example: 
subword = word[:]  # --> creates a copy of the string.
                   # --> Address location of the copy of the string same as  
# tacocat 

# ===========
Python - Negative Indices:
We can use negative indices to count from the end of the string.

word = "tacocat"
character = word[-3] # ---> Third character counting from the end.
                          Last character of a string is access with [-1].
# character = c
subword = word[-3:]  # ---> From third last to the end.
# cat


# ===========
string[start:stop:step]

word = "tacocat"
subword = word[::2]  # ---> From start (0) to end, take every second character!.
# tcct
other = word[1::2]   # ---> Starting with the second character, take every second character!.
# aoa

# ===========
Negative step width.

And now with negative step width!
Now you can cut out any string from a given string!.

word = "taco"       
subword = word[::-1] # ---> want to reverse a string ?. Do it like this!.
# ocat

other = word[::-2]
# oa.


# What does this code do ?. Polyndrome check.
word = "tacocat"
return word == word[::-1]
