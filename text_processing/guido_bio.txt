Guido van Rossum:
I am the author of the Python programming language. 
See also my resume and my publications list, a brief bio, assorted writings, presentations and interviews (all about Python), 
some pictures of me, my new blog, and my old blog on Artima.com. I am @gvanrossum on Twitter.

I am retired, working on personal projects (and maybe a book). 
I have worked for Dropbox, Google, Elemental Security, Zope Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA. (See my resume.) 
I created Python while at CWI.

My Name

My name often poses difficulties for Americans.

Pronunciation: in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G, pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".
However, if you're American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido". 
I'm not too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people have. :-)

Spelling: my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding. 
Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum". 
But when my last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."

Alphabetization: in America, I show up in the alphabet under "V". But in Europe, I show up under "R". 
And some of my friends put me under "G" in their address book...
